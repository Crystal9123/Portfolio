        <p1>About Me 
                I'm Md and I am from Bangladesh, South Asia. While  growing up, I took care of 
                a lot of  cats within my neighbor hood. I enjoy watching anime and playing with cats.\</p1>
                
        <p2>Hobbies/Passions
                 In my spare time, I like to play soccer and play video games such  as Call of Duty 
        and Assassins Creed. In due time,  I would like to be financially independent to be able to travel  around the world. </p2> 

        <p3>Fun Extras
                If I could have any superpower in the world it would be a truth detection  . I would have the 
ability to know the truth about something. I also fed stray dogs  and cats in my home country.
        </p3>

        <p4>Skills
                When it comes down to my strengths in design , I like the back end because of the technical 
aspect.  Often times I like working with Chat GPT because it can explain things in different 
ways. During this project i would like to improve in Figma.
